# Naiwny-Bayes

Naive Bayes Classifier for Iris Dataset
Overview
This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch to classify the Iris dataset. The implementation includes training, testing, and evaluation of the model, as well as manual input classification.


Features
Training and Testing: Uses iris_training.txt for training and iris_test.txt for testing.

Evaluation Metrics: Calculates accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F-measure for each class.

Probability Display: Prints probabilities before and after smoothing.

Manual Input: Allows multiple manual inputs for attribute vectors and provides classification results for each.


Implementation Details
The classifier is implemented in Java without using any machine learning libraries. All counting and probability calculations are done using basic loops and conditionals.
